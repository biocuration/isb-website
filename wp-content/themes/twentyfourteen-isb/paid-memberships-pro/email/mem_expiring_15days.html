<p>Dear colleague, </p>
<p>You are receiving this message because according to our records, your dues for this year are going to expire in 15 days. 
To renew your membership, please use the following link to login and follow the payment link:</p> 
 <a href=http://biocurator.org/membership/membership-account/t> ISB Membership Account</a> 

<p>If you are receiving this email, but have already paid your membership dues, please reply to this email indicating the date and the method of payment (either bank transfer or via PayPal) and we will trace your payment. </p>

<p>Membership dues for this year have again been held at the previous years rates, and it is worth noting that your membership fee provides you with a discounted registration rate to the annual International Biocuration Conference. 
More details on meeting registration will follow as the conference approaches.</p>

<p>Your membership support throughout the last year has allowed the Society to support the annual International Conference for Biocuration, by providing sponsorship for young curators and students. Moreover, your support of the Society helps the ISB promote its goals, which include: encouraging the publication of biocuration articles; exploring how to facilitate data integration from papers through the establishment of collaboration with publishers; improving gold standards, specifically with development of BioDBCore; establishing biocuration as a recognized career option to be promoted to graduates; and maintaining the newsletter and the <a href=http://biocurator.org>Society website</a> as a point of reference for announcements of interest to this group.</p>

<p>Your renewed participation in the ISB will allow it to continue to promote the field of biocuration to the wider scientific community, and to provide opportunities for biocurators to enhance their professional goals and understanding of new methods through the provision of workshops and conferences.</p>

<p>We hope you will choose to renew your much valued membership.</p>

<p>With kind regards,</p>

<p>Your colleagues at the ISB </p>
