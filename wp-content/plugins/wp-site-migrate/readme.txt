1) What information do I need to provide to the plugin?

You will have to provide the plugin your email address, destination url, SFTP host name, SFTP username, and SFTP password.

2) Does this plugin work with Multisite?

Yes! This has been fully developed to work with Multisite. If moving a Multisite, make sure to Network Activate the plugin.

3) Can I migrate a single WordPress install into a Multisite using this plugin?

No. This plugin is designed to migrate sites as is. This plugin will not support single WordPress sites being migrated into a Multisite or a Multisite sub-site being migrated to a single WordPress site.
