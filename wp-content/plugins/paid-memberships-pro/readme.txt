== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I need help installing, configuring, or customizing the plugin. =
Please visit [our support site at http://www.paidmembershipspro.com](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com) for more documentation and our support forums.

= I found a bug in the plugin. =
Please post it in the [WordPress support forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/paid-memberships-pro?forum_id=10) and we'll fix it right away. Thanks for helping. 

= My site is broken or blank or not letting me log in after activating Paid Memberships Pro =
This is typically caused by a conflict with another plugin that is trying to redirect around the login/register pages or trying to redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, etc.

To regain access to your site, FTP to your site and rename the wp-content/plugins/paid-memberships-pro folder to wp-content/plugins/paid-memberhsips-pro-d (or anything different). Now WP will not be able to find PMPro, and you can gain access to /wp-admin/ again. From there, visit the plugins page to fully deactivate Paid Memberships Pro. (You'll want to rename the folder back to paid-memberhsips-pro again.)

Long term, you will need to find and fix the conflict. We can usually do this for you very quickly if you sign up for support at http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/pricing/ and send us your WP admin and FTP credentials.

= Does PMPro Support Multisite/Network Installs? =
"Supporting multisite" means different things to different people.

Out of the box PMPro will basically act as a stand alone plugin for each site. Each site has its own list of membership levels, members, payment settings, etc.

Our [Network/Multisite Add On](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/plus-add-ons/pmpro-network-multisite-membership/) allows members to choose a site name and title at checkout and will set up a network site at checkout.

Our [Network Membership Add On](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/plus-add-ons/pmpro-network-membership/) allows you to manage memberships at the 'Main' Network site and provide or restrict access on other Network Subsites.

If you would like more help using PMPro on a network install, sign up for support at http://www.paidmembershipspro.com.

= Does PMPro Support X? =
Not sure? You can find out by doing a bit a research.

1. [Check our compatibility page](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/compatibility/).
2. [Check our add ons](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/).

= 1.8.12 =
* BUG: Fixed issue where "expiring soon" emails were sometimes sent more than needed.
* BUG: Fixed issue where PayPal Standard IPN requests were being rejected if a tax amount was set in PayPal.
* BUG: Fixed issue with Stripe subscription "updates" that were set to fire on "next payment", e.g. if you used Stripe with levels with a non-zero trial amount. When the update processed and created a new subscription, the old subscription was not being deleted and the new subscription ID was not being saved as a new order for future tracking purposes. If you use this feature, please check in Stripe to make sure your users don't have extra subscriptions.
* BUG: Fixed setting in PayPal/PayPal Express API calls from AUTOBILLAMT to AUTOBILLOUTAMT. This setting is set to AddToNextBilling, meaning that failed payment amounts are added to the next billing cycle's amount if left unpaid. In most cases, a retry of the original billed amount goes through or the user's subscription is cancelled. But just in case, this makes sure that outstanding balances are paid. (Thanks, jubstuff on GitHub)
* BUG: Fixed warnings in the setGateway method of the MemberOrder class for cases where the gateway is missing or the class file is not found.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Moved the pmpro_before_change_membership_level hook to fire a little bit earlier to make it easier to determine the old level status/end date/etc before it gets updated. (Thanks, MrVibe on GitHub)

= 1.8.11.2 =
* BUG: Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.11 that kept PMPro from tracking coupon code uses. Any checkout with a discount code while running 1.8.11 won't have properly tracked the discount code use. You may want to adjust your "uses" numbers for your codes, and hand check any reporting/etc that relied on discount codes. Users of the Sponsored Members addon will have been affected too. Discount codes will need to be made manually for any sponsor who checked out.
* BUG: Fix to the expiration warnings code. Making sure it finds all members who are expiring soon while also keeping track of when emails are sent so users don't get too many emails.
* BUG: Fixed issue where pmpro_before_change_membership_level was running after levels had been changed.
* BUG: Fixed some warnings.
* ENHANCEMENT: Updated Italian translations. (Thanks, Angelo)

* BUG: Fixed warnings in the PayPal IPN handler.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_checkout_level filter and now using that filter to apply the_content filters to the level description at checkout. This allows you to turn off the the_content filters (e.g. processing shortcodes) by using remove_filter('pmpro_checkout_level', 'pmpro_pmpro_checkout_level'); in a custom plugin.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Using the pmpro_confirmation_message filter on the confirmation page whether there is an invoice or not. Now also adding the the_content filters to the confirmation message. You can disable this by using remove_filter('pmpro_confirmation_message', 'pmpro_pmpro_confirmation_message'); in a custom plugin.
* ENHANCEMENT: Now tracking IPN event ids in order notes for recurring orders.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_subscription_ipn_event_processed hook to IPN handler.

* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_getLevelsExpiration() - with an s - function to get the combined expiration text for multiple levels in array.
* ENHANCEMENT: Created the pmpro_getLevelAtCheckout function that modularizes some of the logic of creating the pmpro_level global at checkout.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_members_list_user filter used on the admin members list and members list CSV export.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a 4th parameter $cancel_level to pmpro_changeMembershipLevel(). If set, that level will definitely be cancelled locally and at the gateway. This parameter is also passed to the pmpro_before_change_membership_level and pmpro_after_change_membership_level hook.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a new function pmpro_cancelMembershipLevel($level_id, $user_id, $old_level_status) that acts as a wrapper to pass the $cancel_level param to pmpro_changeMembershipLevel().
* ENHANCEMENT: Updated the cancel page on the frontend to support the Multiple Memberships per User addon. All memberships are shown. You can cancel individual memberships separately. The language of the confirm button mentions memberships vs account.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_getMemberOrdersByCheckoutID($checkout_id) function to support Multiple Memberships per User and others using the checkout_id.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a refund($order, $transaction_id) method to the PMPro_stripe class. This will be used by the Multiple Memberships per User addon and eventually used in other areas by the core pluginn.

= 1.8.10.4 =
* BUG: Fixed issue where non-decimal currencies (e.g. Japanese Yen) were sending invalid amounts to the Stripe gateway.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: If an invalid discount code is applied at checkout, we now set the code_level JS var to false. Along with updates to the Pay by Check addon, this fixes issues with the Pay by Check addon where users could not checkout when using a discount code that reduced the price to free.

* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Now using the current_time function in profile.php to avoid off-by-one errors when changing members' expiration dates.

* BUG: Updated Stripe and Braintree gateways to load billing fields and JavaScript when it's the default gateway (if not the current gateway specified).
* BUG: Fixed bug where cancelation emails weren't being sent to users if they originated from PayPal.
* BUG: Fixed bug where unsucessful invoices were shown on the Membership Account page. We aren't showing refunded invoices here now either, but plan to in the future.
* BUG: The update billing page now uses the pmpro_include_billing_address_fields filter so gateways and addons can properly override the payment fields when needed.
* BUG: The update billing page now uses the validatecreditcard.js script to set the Card Type in the background, just like checkout. Fixes some issues with updating credit cards on certain gateways.
* BUG: Reintroduced the pmpro_members_list_sql filter.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Switched the Japanese Yen and South Korean Won to not use decimals by default. (Thanks, flatworld21 on wp.org)
* ENHANCEMENT: Added an option to skip the confirmation step with PayPal Express.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added the pmpro_membership_levels_table filter on the membership levels page of the dashboard to allow addons (like the upcoming MMPU addon) to override the HTML for the table shown.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added the checkout_id column to the pmpro_membership_orders table. This will be used by addons and possible core in the future to track multiple orders that happen during the same checkout process.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added support for the Serian language. (Thanks, Sasa Trifkovic)
* NOTE: We are planning to remove the certificate_id and certificate_amount columns from the pmpro_membership_orders table. Please contact us if you are using this column for something to come up with a work around.

= 1.8.9.3 =
* BUG: Fixed bug introduced in 1.8.9.2 where member start and end dates weren't being set correctly. Includes an update script to fix past users affected by this.
* BUG: Fixed warnings on new order page in the dashboard.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed the pmpro_checkout_default_submit_button() methods of the PayPal Express to no longer check if the current gateway is a paypal one. The method is only called when the gateway is loaded anyway or when another addon (e.g. the pmpro-pay-by-check addon) adds the hook.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Moved check instructions code into the check gateway class so it can be overriden by addons (e.g. an update to the pmpro-pay-by-check addon).

= 1.8.9.2 =
* BUG: Fixed SQL in pmpro_changeMembershipLevel that caused issues with some MySQL setups.
* BUG: Fixed URL PayPal Express and PayPal standard redirect to at checkout. (Although the incorrect URL was still working on the PayPal side.)
* BUG: Addon page now passes $status to the plugin_row_meta filter to fix warnings that were sometimes showing up. (Thanks, jawhite)
* BUG: Fixed typo in the pmpro_orders_csv_extra_columns filter introduced in 1.8.9.1. (Thanks, Johannes Jokelin)

= 1.8.9.1 =
* BUG: Fixed bug where some recurring orders members who checked out with Stripe in very old versions of PMPro would show up as orders with a blank user_id and membership_id. This update includes a fix for this and an update script to fix old orders affected by this.
* BUG: Fixed bug where the Stripe class activation/deactivation methods were setup too late to actually run on activation/deactivation.
* BUG: Updated the Stripe class to use the same language and markup in the Payment Information section as the default checkout.
* BUG: Now forcing pmpro_getMembershipLevelForUser() in admin change emails.
* BUG: Fixed warning in comments_array and comments_open filters. (Thanks, Mihail Chepovskiy)
* BUG: Fixed format error for dates when saving orders. (Thanks, EmreErdogan)
* BUG: Fixed bug that was causing issues in the cancellations report.
* BUG: Fixed the pmpro_cron_expiration_warnings script to properly skip deleted and already expired members.
* BUG: Reverted code to generate the CVV popup URL.
* BUG: Fixed a couple bugs in the pmpro_loadTemplate function.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Updated URL used in the IPN Handler API calls to match the latest PayPal docs. (Thanks, pbaylies)
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Overhauled the orders list CSV export for improved performance. There is still scaling work to be done on the exports, but timeouts and memory errors will happen much less often.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added Greek (el_GR) translation. (Thanks, Alexandros Karypidis)
* ENHANCEMENT: Added $order as a parameter to the pmpro_orders_user_row_actions hook. (Thanks, SquareLines)
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a warning to backup your database to the update notice.

= 1.8.9 =
* BUG: Fixed bug with recurring orders and TwoCheckout.
* BUG: Fixed bug where some non-members (membership_id was 0 or NULL) were being processed for expiration.
* BUG: Fixed bug where the address/street wasn't showing up when printing orders from the dashboard.
* BUG: Fixed bug where the Stripe class would sometimes show its billing and payment fields even if a secondary gateway was chosen.
* BUG: Making sure $this->total is set for new orders and available to the pmpro_add_order, pmpro_added_order filters.
* BUG: Fixed bug where email templates were not being loaded out of the /paid-memberships-pro/languages/email/ directory. (Thanks, menardmam on wordpress.org)
* BUG: No longer showing a "renew" link on the membership account or membership levels pages if the user's level is not allowing sign ups.
* BUG: Fixed bug where the expiration script might try to run on deleted or expired users.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Change membership shortcode to call pmpro_hasMembershipLevel when checking for level="" as well. This ensures the pmpro_has_membership_level filter runs, which some addons/etc need.
* ENHANCEMENT: Updated categories list on the edit levels page to show nested categories.
* ENHANCEMENT: Now adding a pmpro-no-access class (similar to the pmpro-has-access class) to the post element if a user doesn't have access to that post.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_checkout_end_date filter, similar to pmpro_checkout_start_date. Takes params $enddate, $user_id, $pmpro_level, $startdate.
