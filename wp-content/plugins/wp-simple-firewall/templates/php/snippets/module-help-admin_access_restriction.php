<h2>What is the Security Admin?</h2>
<p>Imagine someone somehow gets access to your WordPress admin dashboard.</p>
<p>If it was me, the first thing I'd do is fiddle with and disable any security plugins.</p>
<p>But with Shield's Security Admin module, this isn't a problem. When active this feature will prevent
   any user, admin or otherwise, from viewing or modifying any Shield options, as well as preventing the
   plugin from being deactivated.
</p>
<p><strong>We highly recommend turning on this option.</strong>
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>How do I activate the Security Admin?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Currently the security admin is authenticated with the 'Security Admin Key'.</p>
		<p>You can't turn on the security admin feature without first supplying the key.</p>
		<p>On the main Enable / Disable section, you must check on the checkbox and supply a key. You must
		   remember this key, because you'll be asked for it later.
		</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>I never gave a key and now it's asking me for a key! What key is it talking about?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>You mightn't think you supplied a key in the past because you can't remember giving it a key.
		   But if it's asking you for a key, then you (or someone else) gave it a key.
		</p>
		<p>Can you tell we get this question a lot? (though usually far less politely presented)</p>
		<p>Still can't remember the key? See below...</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>How can I change my key and access Shield if I don't know the key?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>You have 1 of 2 options. The 2nd is a little drastic and if you can do the 2nd, you can certainly
		   do the 1st option - which is the recommended.

			<li>Follow the guide <a href="http://icwp.io/am" target="_blank">set out here</a>. Once you've
				turned off the Shield plugin you can go in and set the access key to whatever you like,
				and then remove the 'forceoff' file.
			</li>
			<li>Follow the guide <a href="http://icwp.io/al" target="_blank">set out here</a> to reset
				your plugin to default settings.
