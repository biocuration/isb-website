		<h3>Running Wizards is not supported on your web hosting.</h3>
		<p>You're site is running PHP Version <strong><?php echo $data[ 'phpversion' ]; ?></strong>.</p>
		<p>Running Shield Wizards requires at least <strong>PHP 5.4</strong>.
		   <br />PHP 5.4 was released around 6 years ago and by now,
		   any <strong>decent webhost</strong> will have provisioned support for <em>at least</em> this
		   version of PHP. Check with your webhost or site developer to see about switching up your PHP version
		   because you're running your website on old, outdated, non-maintained software. And if you're PHP
		   is this far out-of-date, you gotta wonder what else on your webhost needs some important upgrades.
		</p>
		<p>Website security covers many areas, and running your webhost/server on up-to-date software is
		   a critical one of these areas.</p>
		<p>Note: As Shield Security is further developed, more and more features will require higher versions of PHP.</p>
