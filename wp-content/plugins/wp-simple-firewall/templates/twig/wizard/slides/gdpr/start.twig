	<p>What is the GDPR Data Wizard?</p>
	<p>The purpose of the GDPR data wizard is to help you examine which data the Shield Security
	   plugin is storing in its databases that pertains to individuals and may contain private,
	   or personally identifiable information.</p>
	<h5>Why is this important?</h5>
	<p>With GDPR regulations, any individual may ask you at any time about what data you have stored about
	   them and you will be required to present it to them.</p>
	<p>You may additionally be asked to remove this data.</p>
	<p>This wizard will walk you through the search for such data, and the subsequent removal of it.</p>
