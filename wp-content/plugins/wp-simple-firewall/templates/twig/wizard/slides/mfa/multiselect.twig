	<p>As we outlined on the first slide in this wizard, if you have a password and 1 extra factor,
	   you have what is known as "Two-Factor Authentication".</p>
	<p>But if you have more than 1 extra factor, you have what is called
	   "Multi-Factor Authentication".</p>
	<p>You have a choice between either of these, now that you've configured other login factors.</p>
	<p>You can either set that <strong>all extra login factors</strong> are required when a user logs on.
	   Or you can set that <strong>only 1 extra login factor</strong> is required.</p>
	<p>The balance here of course is between an easier user experience, or harder site security.
	   The choice is yours.</p>
