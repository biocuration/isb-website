	<p>What is the Plugin & Theme Guard?</p>
	<p>The purpose of this scanner is to detect potentially malicious or
	   unintended changes to plugin and theme files.</p>
	<p>Why is this important?</p>
	<p>It is common for hacks to involve modifications to existing plugin and theme files.</p>
	<p>This scanner will detect filesystem changes that have occurred outside normal WordPress operations, specifically:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>files where content has been modified</li>
		<li>files that are missing</li>
		<li>files that have been added</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you're in doubt about the results, please discuss the findings with your hosting provider.</p>
