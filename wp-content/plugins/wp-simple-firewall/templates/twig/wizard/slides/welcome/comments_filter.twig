<h3>Comment SPAM</h3>
<h4>Quick Summary:</h4>
<p>Shield can block 100% of automated Comment SPAM sent by "bots". You can turn it on below.</p>
<h4>The Details:</h4>
<p>99%+ of comments spam is by automated bots. You get some human SPAM too, of course.</p>
<p>Shield Security offers a couple of highly effective techniques to block bot spam.
   Also, and unlike Akismet, we never send your private comment data to 3rd parties for
   processing. You keep it all in-house - i.e. it stays on your own website.
</p>
<p>We also offer Google reCAPTCHA for comments, but you'll need to setup some API keys for this first, so we'll
   leave you to do that later.</p>
<p>There's also an option to protect against Human SPAMmers. But again, to get
   you going, we'll leave you to set that up later if you wish.</p>
