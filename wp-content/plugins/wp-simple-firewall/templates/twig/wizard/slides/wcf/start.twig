	<h3>Start: WordPress Core File Scanner</h3>
	<p>What is the WordPress Core File Scanner?</p>
	<p>The purpose of this scanner is to detect potentially malicious or
	   unintended changes to any of the Core WordPress files.
	   This is quite different to the Unrecognised File Scanner, which aims to detect
	   the presence of files that are not part of the official set of WordPress core files.</p>
	<p>Why is this important?</p>
	<p>Your site may already be compromised and you wouldn't know it by glancing at which core
	   files are installed on your site. The only way to know if your core WordPress files
	   have been modified in any way is to compare them against the official files.</p>
	<p>This scanner will do exactly that and report to you any files it finds to be different.</p>
	<p>If you're in doubt about the results, please discuss the findings with your hosting provider.</p>
