### The highest rated 5* Security Plugin for WordPress

Shield - highest average 5* rating for any WordPress security plugin (2019/05). [See what people are saying here](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-simple-firewall/reviews/?filter=5).

#### It's 2020 - Don't settle for just another security plugin. Get *smarter* security.

You don't need another 100 email notifications.

You **need** a security plugin that does **all** the heavy lifting for you, and only alerts you when you need to know.

And when you get an alert, you actually have steps to take, not just the position of "I have no clue what to do!"

### Security for WordPress *doesn't* have to be *hard*

There's no reason for security to be so darn complicated. It doesn't have to be this way any longer.

Shield is the easiest security plugin to setup - you simply activate it.

And you can gradually dig deeper, as you're ready.

#### Trust: Shield Does Exactly What It Says It Will Do

You've probably been let down in the past, but Shield is the WordPress Security solution that does what it says it'll do - Protect Your Site.

#### Constant notifications are not okay. You're already busy!

Receiving constant alerts from your security plugins isn't "security". It's just noise. By the time you receive a notification and respond to it, it's already too late.

Instead, Shield Security does it what it needs to do, and alerts you if and when you need to informed.

Shield is your Silent Guardian. It doesn't squawk at you every time a visitor presses against your defenses.

It'll do *its job* without moaning at you, and leave you in peace to get on with *your job*.

#### You're not alone, and there's no risk to test it out.

You can try out Shield alongside any other security plugins, and it [comes highly recommended](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-simple-firewall/reviews/)
- it has the highest average rating for any WP Security plugin.

Easy-to-setup, but powerful protection blocks attacks and suspicious activity, but won't lock you out.

= Login and Identity Security Protection - Stops Brute Force Attacks =

Note: Login Guard is a completely independent feature to the Firewall.

With the Login Guard this plugin will single-handedly prevent brute force login attacks on all your WordPress sites.

It doesn't need IP Address Ban Lists (which are actually useless anyway), and instead puts hard limits on your WordPress site,
and force users to verify themselves when they login.

Three core security features provide layers to protect the WordPress Login system.

1.	[Email-based 2-Factor Login Authentication](https://shsec.io/2v) based on IP address! (prevents brute force login attacks)
1.	[Login Cooldown Interval](https://shsec.io/2t) - WordPress will only process 1 login per interval in seconds (prevents brute force login attacks)
1.	[GASP Anti-Bot Login Form Protection](https://shsec.io/2u) - Adds 2 protection checks for all WordPress login attempts (prevents brute force login attacks using Bots)

These options alone will protect and secure your WordPress sites from nearly all forms of Brute Force login attacks.

And you hardly need to configure anything! Simply check the options to turn them on, set a cooldown interval and you're instantly protected.

= SPAM and Comments Filtering =

As of version 1.6, this plugin integrates [GASP Spambot Protection](http://wordpress.org/plugins/growmap-anti-spambot-plugin/).

We have taken this functionality a level further and added the concept of unique, per-page visit, Comment Tokens.

**Comment Tokens** are unique keys that are created every time a page loads and they are uniquely generated based on 3 factors:

1.	The visitors IP address.
1.	The Page they are viewing
1.	A unique, random number, generated at the time the page is loaded.

This is all handle automatically and your users will not be affected - they'll still just have a checkbox like the original GASP plugin.

These comment tokens are then embedded in the comment form and must be presented to your WordPress site when a comment is posted.  The plugin
will then examine the token, the IP address from which the comment is coming, and page upon which the comment is being posted.  They must
all match before the comment is accepted.

Furthermore, we place a cooldown (i.e. you must wait X seconds before you can post using that token) and an expiration on these comment tokens.
The reasons for this are:

1.	Cooldown means that a spambot cannot load a page, read the unique comment token and immediately re-post a comment to that page. It must wait
a while.  This has the effect of slowing down the spambots, and, if the spambots get it wrong, they've wasted that token - as tokens can only
be used once.
1.	Expirations mean that a spambot cannot get the token and use it whenever it likes, it must use it within the specfied time.

This all combines to make it much more difficult for spambots (and also human spammers as they have to now wait) to work their dirty magic :)

== Installation ==

Note: When you enable the plugin, the firewall is not automatically turned on. This plugin contains various different sections of
protection for your site and you should choose which you need based on your own requirements.

Why do we do this? It's simple: performance and optimization - there is no reason to automatically turn on features for people that don't
need it as each site and set of requirements is different.

This plugin should install as any other WordPress.org respository plugin.

1.	Browse to Plugins -> Add Plugin
1.	Search: Shield
1.	Click Install
1.	Click to Activate.

A new menu item will appear on the left-hand side called 'Shield'.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Please see the dedicated [help centre](https://shsec.io/firewallhelp) for details on features and some FAQs.

= How does the Shield compare with other WordPress Security Plugins? =

Easy - we're just better! ;)

Firstly, we don't modify a single core WordPress or web hosting file. This is important and explains why randomly you upgrade your security plugin and your site dies.

Ideally you shouldn't use this along side other Anti-SPAM plugins or security plugins. If there is a feature you need, please feel free to suggest it in the support forums.

= My server has a firewall, why do I need this plugin? =

This plugin is an application layer firewall, not a server/network firewall.  It is designed to interpret web calls to your site to
look for attempts to circumvent it and gain unauthorized access.

Your network firewall is designed to restrict access to your server based on certain types of network traffic.  The Shield
is designed to restrict access to your site, based on certain type of web calls.

= How does the IP Whitelist work? =

Any IP address that is on the whitelist will not be subject to **any of the firewall processing**.  This setting takes priority over all other settings.

= Does the IP Whitelist support IP ranges? =

Yes. To specify a range you use CIDR notation.  E.g. ABC.DEF.GHJ.KMP/16

= I want to black list an IP address, where can I do that? =

You can't. The plugin runs an automatic black list IP system so you don't need to maintain any manual lists.

= I've locked myself out from my own site! =

This happens when any the following 3 conditions are met:

*	you have added your IP address to the firewall blacklist,
*	you have enabled 2 factor authentication and email doesn't work on your site (and you haven't chosen the override option)

You can completely turn OFF (and ON) the Shield by creating a special file in the plugin folder.

Here's how:

1.	Open up an FTP connection to your site, browse to the plugin folder <your site WordPress root>/wp-content/plugins/wp-simple-firewall/
1.	Create a new file in here called: "forceOff".
1.	Load any page on your WordPress site.
1.	After this, you'll find your Shield has been switched off.

If you want to turn the firewall on in the same way, create a file called "forceOn".

Remember: If you leave one of these files on the server, it will override your on/off settings, so you should delete it when you no longer need it.

= Which takes precedence... whitelist or blacklist? =

Whitelist. So if you have the same address in both lists, it'll be whitelisted and allowed to pass before the blacklist comes into effect.

= What changes go into each version? =

The changelog outlines the main changes for each release. We group changes by minor release "Series". Changes in smaller "point" releases are highlighted
 using **(.1)** notation.  So for example, version 4.4**.1** will have changelog items appended with **(.1)**

= Can I assist with development? =

Yes! We actively [develop our plugin on Github](https://github.com/FernleafSystems/wp-simple-firewall) and the best thing you can do is submit pull request and bug reports which we'll review.

= How does the pages/parameters whitelist work? =

It is a comma-separated list of pages and parameters. A NEW LINE should be taken for each new page name and its associated parameters.

The first entry on each line (before the first comma) is the page name. The rest of the items on the line are the parameters.

The following are some simple examples to illustrate:

**edit.php, featured**

On the edit.php page, the parameter with the name 'featured' will be ignored.

**admin.php, url, param01, password**

Any parameters that are passed to the page ending in 'admin.php' with the names 'url', 'param01' and 'password' will
be excluded from the firewall processing.

*, url, param, password

Putting a star first means that these exclusions apply to all pages.  So for every page that is accessed, all the parameters
that are url, param and password will be ignored by the firewall.

= How does the login cooldown work? =

When enabled the plugin will prevent more than 1 login attempt to your site every "so-many" seconds.  So if you enable a login cooldown
of 60 seconds, only 1 login attempt will be processed every 60 seconds.  If you login incorrectly, you wont be able to attempt another
login for a further 60 seconds.

More Info: https://shsec.io/2t

= How does the GASP Login Guard work? =

This is best [described on the blog](https://shsec.io/2u)

= How does the 2-factor authentication work? =

[2-Factor Authentication is best described here](https://shsec.io/2v).

= I'm getting an update message although I have auto update enabled? =

The Automatic (Background) WordPress updates happens on a WordPress schedule - it doesn't happen immediately when an update is detected.
You can either manually upgrade, or WordPress will handle it in due course.

= How can I remove the WordPress admin footer message that displays my IP address? =

You can add some custom code to your functions.php exactly as the following:

`add_filter( 'icwp_wpsf_print_admin_ip_footer', '__return_false' );`

= How can I change the text/html in the Plugin Badge? =

Use the following filter and return the HTML/Text you wish to display:

`add_filter( 'icwp_shield_plugin_badge_text', 'your_function_to_return_text' );`

= How can I change the roles for login notification emails? =

Use the following filter and return the role in the function:

`add_filter( 'icwp-wpsf-login-notification-email-role', 'your_function_to_return_role' );`

Possible options are: network_admin, administrator, editor, author, contributor, subscriber
