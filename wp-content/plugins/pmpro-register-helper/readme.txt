Capture additional member information with custom fields at Membership Checkout with Paid Memberships Pro.

== Description ==
A robust add on to collect additional fields at membership signup. Fields can be collected at membership checkout, on the user's profile or for administrative view-only.

You can also restrict membership registration for a list of approved email addresses.

[Read the full documentation for the Register Helper Add On](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/pmpro-register-helper-add-checkout-and-profile-fields/)

= Supports Multiple Field Types =
Using Register Helper, you can add a variety of field types to capture additional information about your members. Supported field types include:
* Text and Textarea
* Select and Select2 (multi-select)
* Checkbox and Radio
* File Upload
* HTML (generates any desired HTML)
* Hidden

= Fields Per Levels and Conditional Fields =
Fields can be added based on the member's selected level. This means that you can collect specific member information for one level and other unique member information for another level.

Any registered field can be dynamically hidden or shown with JavaScript depending on another fieldâ€™s value. To create a conditional field, pass an array of conditions as the depends option.

= Adding Sections to Membership Checkout =
Register Helper allows you to add fields to a variety of places within the Membership Checkout page using Paid Memberships Pro. Fields can be added to existing locations including:

* after_username
* after_password
* after_email
* after_captcha
* after_billing_fields
* before_submit_button
* just_profile

Or, you can add a new box or section to the Membership Checkout form using the 'checkout_boxes' feature. Your newly created box includes a title, description and specified location.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-register-helper` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Configure your fields using custom code. [View the full documentation on adding fields](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/documentation/register-helper-documentation/adding-fields/)

= Example Code for adding a Company field =
Below is a sample code that adds a "Company" field. Custom code for your fields should be placed in your active theme's functions.php file or [a plugin for customizations](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/create-a-plugin-for-pmpro-customizations/) (our recommended method). 

`function my_pmprorh_init( ) {
	//don't break if Register Helper is not loaded
	if( ! function_exists ( 'pmprorh_add_registration_field' ) ) {
		return false;
	}
	
	//define the fields
	$fields = array();
	
	$fields[] = new PMProRH_Field (
		'company',
		'text',
		array(
			'label' => 'Company',
			'profile' => true,
	));
	
	//add the fields into a new checkout_boxes are of the checkout page
	foreach( $fields as $field ) {
		pmprorh_add_registration_field(
			'checkout_boxes', // location on checkout page
			$field            // PMProRH_Field object
		);
	}
}
add_action( 'init', 'my_pmprorh_init' );`

The register helper plugin has been updated to update user meta fields during this hook in addition to the pmpro_after_checkout hook. (Because for PayPal Standard, when pmpro_after_checkout is called, the $_SESSION vars are unavailable to it. So other plugins relying on the pmpro_after_checkout hook may have issues with PayPal Standard.)

* Added the "divclass" property to fields, which will add a class to the wrapping div around the fields.
* Added a span * required to required fields.

= .2.1 =
